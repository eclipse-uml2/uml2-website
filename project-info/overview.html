<p>
UML2 is an EMF-based implementation of the <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling_spec_catalog.htm#UML">Unified Modeling Language (UML<sup>TM</sup>) 2.x</a> OMG metamodel for the Eclipse platform.
</p>
<p>
The objectives of the UML2 component are to provide
<ul>
  <li>a useable implementation of the UML metamodel to support the development of modeling tools</li>
  <li>a common XMI schema to facilitate interchange of semantic models</li>
  <li>test cases as a means of validating the specification</li>
  <li>validation rules as a means of defining and enforcing levels of compliance</li>
</ul>
</p>
